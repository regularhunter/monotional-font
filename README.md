# Monotional

### Version 1.0

Monotional is a humanist, monospace font based on 
[DejaVu Sans Mono]](https://github.com/dejavu-fonts/dejavu-fonts) and 
inspired by André Berg's [Meslo](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font).

I began maintaining a 
[downstream fork of Meslo](https://github.com/regularhunter/Meslo-Font/) 
in order to fix some issues with it until I realized it would be easier to 
start over from scratch with DejaVu Sans Mono, which is itself based on 
Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.
